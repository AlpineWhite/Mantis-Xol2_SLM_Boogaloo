| Tap six M2 holes in the *Carriage* as indicated. The bottom four are for probe mounting and the rear two are for microswitches.  | ![Carriage M2 Holes](/Images/Assembly/carriage_tap6x_m2.PNG "Carriage M2 Tapped Holes")  |
| Tap two M2 holes in the *Dogbone* as indicated for belt pretensioning.  |  ![Dogbone M2 Holes](/Images/Assembly/tap_to_M2_dogbone.PNG "Belt Tensioning M2 Tapped Holes")  |
| Tap four M2 holes in the *Hotend Mount* for part cooling fans. You only need to go 8-10mm deep on the long rear holes. Going deeper risks breaking a tap. |  ![Hotend Fan M2](/Images/Assembly/holder_tap_4x_m2.PNG "Cooling Fan Tapped Holes")  |
