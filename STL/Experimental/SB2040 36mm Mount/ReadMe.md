This is just a simple adapter plate to mount an sb2040 or any Stealthburner PCB to a nema14 36mm pancake stepper.

Make sure that the spacers between the motor mounts and the printed mount are as short as possible meaning the printed mount, will touch the motor casing to improve stability. 

### Parts needed:
2x M3x6 BHCS
1x M3x16 BHCS or SHCS (personal preference) 
4x standard Voron heatset insert (2 per spacer)
2x 15mm spacer (check how thick your motor is. See above explanation)




## Update 1.0: 
Fixes the Rotation of the PCB to make it onboard ADXL compatible woohoo
Removes 1 M3x6 screw
Adds 1 M3x16 screw
