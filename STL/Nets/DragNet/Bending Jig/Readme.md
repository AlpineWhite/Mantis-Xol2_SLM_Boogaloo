| If you wish to use a hammer or other non-press/vise tool, press the tabs down against the plastic.  |  ![Hammertime](/Images/Assembly/DragNet_bending/Alt_Finish.PNG "Viseless Bending") |
| If using a vise or press, lay the top piece on the flat, and compress the sandwich to create the bend. |  ![Bending](/Images/Assembly/DragNet_bending/step4.PNG "Bending") |
| Carefully remove the new-bent DragNet from the jig. You may need to squeeze the tabs a little to compensate for springback. | ![Finished](/Images/Assembly/DragNet_bending/net.PNG "Job Done")  |
